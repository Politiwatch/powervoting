        <p>PowerVoting uses the closeness of elections and the number of voters per unit of power (e.g., representative,
          senator, or elector) at the federal level to find the relative “impact” of a vote for the addresses you look
          up.</p>
        <p>Election closeness is calculated by subtracting the percentage victory margin between the first and second
          place candidates in an election from one. This closeness score is calculated for every historical election in
          the district since 1976, then displayed as a chart on the results page. The overall closeness score for the
          district is a weighted average of these individual election scores, with increasingly recent elections
          weighted according to the square of the number of years since 1975.</p>
        <p>The power per vote (PPV) is calculated by dividing the average units of power in an election (1 for house and senate
          elections, the number of electors in the state for presidential elections) over the two most recent election’s
          turnouts in the district (or, in the case of senate and presidential elections, the state). More simply, this metric quantifies the ‘slice’ of the representative or elector that
          an individual vote corresponds to.</p>
        <p>The overall impact score is the product of the overall closeness score and the most recent PPV score for the
          district multiplied by one million (to make the number more accessible and intuitive). A higher impact score
          for a district means generally closer elections and more power per vote.</p>
